Blinking of LED is a simple project in Embedded progamming world. There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. You can make one using relays. You can make one using transistors. Or you can make one using components like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. Here swtich is used to blink the two LED using ATmega328(a microcontroller).
